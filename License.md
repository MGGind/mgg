Standard License
Basics
The Standard License provides you the non-exclusive right to use the Theme you bought.
You are legally permitted to use the Item to build one End Product for yourself or for a client (a “single application”), and the End Product can be distributed for free.

You can ✅ –
Build one End Product for a client, transfer that End Product to them, and charge them for your services. The license is then passed to the client.
Create duplicates of the single End Product as long as it is distributed for free.
Modify or combine the Theme with other works to create a copy. This license applies to the outcome. This clause also applies to extracting individual components from the Theme and using them in derivative works.

You cannot ❌ –
Sell the End Product to multiple clients.
Redistribute the source code of the Theme, modified or not.
The Theme can be used in applications that allow the End users to modify and customize the Theme, like “build it yourself” or “theme generators.”
Permit the final user of the End Product to access the Theme’s source and use it separately from the End Product.

If a Theme uses codes, images, or other content from somewhere else with a different license, that item keeps the license from where it came from. The theme’s author will note the license for any code, images, or content. You have to be responsible for sticking to the original license or getting permission from the author of the code, image, or content.
Breach of any kind will result in the license termination and your right to distribute the End Product until the Theme is completely removed from the End Product.

Multisite License
Basics
The Multisite License grants you a universal right to use the Theme you purchased.
You are authorized to use the Item to create unlimited End Products for yourself or multiple clients; the End Products can also be distributed for Free.

You can ✅ –
Create as many End Products as needed, transfer that to your clients, and charge them for your services. The client is granted the equivalent of a Standard License. They do not assume the Multisite License’s unlimited use.
Make an unlimited number of copies of a single End Product as long as it is distributed for free.
Modify or combine the Theme with other works to create a derivative. This license applies to the result. This clause also applies to extracting individual components from the Theme and using them in the derivatives.

You cannot ❌ –
Sell the End Product to anyone other than the clients.
Hand out the Theme’s source, modified or not, even if the Theme is modified.
Use the Theme in any program that lets the End User change the Theme, such as “build it yourself” or “theme generators.”
Permit access to the Theme’s source and use it separately from an end product to an End User.

If a Theme uses code, images, or other content from somewhere else with a different license, that item retains the original one. The theme’s author will note the license for any code, images, or content. You are responsible for sticking to the original license or getting permission from the code, image, or content creator.
Breach of any sort will result in the termination of the license and losing the distribution rights of the End Products until the Theme is fully removed from the End Product.
Extended License
Basics
The Extended License gives you a non-exclusive right to use the Theme you have bought.
You are licensed to use the Item and create a single End Product for yourself or for a client (a “single application”), and the End Product can be sold or distributed for free.

You can ✅ –
Create one End Product for a client, hand it to them, and charge them for your services. The license is then handed to the client.
Sell and create an unlimited number of versions of the single End Product.
Modify or incorporate the Theme with other works to create a derivative work. This license applies to the outcome. This clause also applies to extracting individual components from the Theme and using them in derivative works.

You cannot ❌ –
Use the Theme to create multiple distinct End Products. This is a “single application” license instead of a “multi-use” one.
Re-distribute the Theme’s source code, regardless of modifications, even if the Theme has been modified.
Use the Theme in any application allowing an End User to customize the Theme, like “build it yourself” or “theme generators.” You can purchase separate licenses for each final product incorporating the theme created using the application.
Allow the End User access to the theme source and use it separately from the End Product.

If a Theme includes code, images, or contents registered under a different license, that item retains its original license. The Theme author will note the license for the code, images, or content. You must comply with the original license or obtain permission from the code, image, or content author.
Violation of any clause of this license will result in losing the right to distribute the End Product until the Theme is completely removed from the End Product.
